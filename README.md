# Janus Toolkit

This is a collection of tools to help you inject custom code in APKs without changing the APK Signature v1.

This method only works in Android Marshmallow (SDK 23) or below as the exploit Janus \[CVE-2017-13156\] has been fixed by Google in Android Nougat (SDK 24).

## Usage

First extract the `AndroidManifest.xml` from the target APK using [Apktool].

Then run `manifest_dummy.py` to generate dummy classes to include in your Android Studio project. 
(The necessary tags generated by this script are only needed if you set `shrinkEnabled true` in your `build.gradle`)

TODO: Complete the guide. Extra instructions in [this][janus_poc] repo.
